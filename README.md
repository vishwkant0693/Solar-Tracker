# Solar-Tracker
This project presents an open hardware/software test bench for solar tracker. The proposed prototype is based on a dual-axis solar tracker controlled with Arduino Uno which is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. The solar tracker can be controlled automatically with the help of LightDependent Resistor (LDR) sensors or manually using a potentiometer. Moreover, this test bench provides virtual instrumentation based on Excel in which its solar tracker data can be recorded and presented. The hardware used has been chosen to be inexpensive, compact and versatile.
